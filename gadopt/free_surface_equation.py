r"""
This module contains the scalar terms and equations (e.g. for temperature and salinity transport)

NOTE: for all terms, the residual() method returns the residual as it would be on the RHS of the equation, i.e.:

  dq/dt = \sum term.residual()

This sign-convention is for compatibility with Thetis' timeintegrators. In general, however we like to think about
the terms as they are on the LHS. Therefore in the residual methods below we assemble in F as it would be on the LHS:

  dq/dt + F(q) = 0

and at the very end "return -F".
